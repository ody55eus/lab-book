non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise
the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;
and</p></li>
<li><p>produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License
does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
conditions.</p></li>

<a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s6a">6(a)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make
technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives
and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You
from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to
circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this
Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this
Section
<a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s2a4">2(a)(4)</a>
never produces Adapted Material.</p></li>
<li><p>Downstream recipients.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
conditions of this Public License.</p></li>
<li><p>No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if
doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any
recipient of the Licensed Material.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or
that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or
sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor
or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
<a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a1Ai">3(a)(1)(A)(i)</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Other rights</strong>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or
other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible,
the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights
held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You
to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
License.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights,
whether directly or through a collecting society under any
voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In
all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to
collect such royalties.</p></li>

<li><p>indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
indication of any previous modifications; and</p></li>
<li><p>indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to,
this Public License.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>You may satisfy the conditions in Section
<a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a1">3(a)(1)</a>

reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.</p></li>
<li><p>If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
information required by Section

You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from
complying with this Public License.</p></li>

<a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s2a1">2(a)(1)</a>
grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database;</p></li>
<li><p>if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
individual contents) is Adapted Material; and</p></li>
<li><p>You must comply with the conditions in Section
<a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s3a">3(a)</a>
if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
database.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section
<a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s4">4</a>
supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public
License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar
Rights.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</strong></p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p><strong>Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied,
statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of
title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or
discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full
or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to
You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,
most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
liability.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Section 6 – Term and Termination.</strong></p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate

<li><p>Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
Section

it reinstates:</p>

is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or</p></li>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section
<a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s6b">6(b)</a>
does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
Your violations of this Public License.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="3">
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the

this Public License.</p></li>
<li><p>Sections
<a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s1">1</a>,

<a class="reference external" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s8">8</a>
survive termination of this Public License.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.</strong></p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms
or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</p></li>

<p><strong>Section 8 – Interpretation.</strong></p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions
on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made
without permission under this Public License.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that
apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of
any jurisdiction or authority.</p></li>
