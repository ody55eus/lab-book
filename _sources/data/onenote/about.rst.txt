About OneNote Notebooks
=======================

This Lab Book was originally written in OneNote.
In the beginning we thought that this would be a good way to organize and structure all data.
This has been a huge advantage to document a lot of data with little effort.

We want to gain more knowlegde about the data.
The easiest way is restructuring the data to make them more accessible.

OneNote Export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately the original lab book can not be easily
adapted from Microsoft OneNote to this format.
Therefore different approaches have been tested to extract the information.

PDF
+++

OneNote can export the notebooks into a pdf document.
This is like printing the documents.
This process is not helpful for a sustainable documentation.


Word
++++

The second way to export the notebooks is a Word document (.docx).
This is more accessible but still connected with the loss of information.
This approach has been used to separate the text from the images and export it.

Other Exports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HTML
++++

In :ref:`html-files` the exported notebooks (.docx) have been converted to html to make them more accessible.
This has been done with Word.


RST
+++

Additionally, using Pandoc_ the Word documents can also be converted directly into reStructuredText (.rst) while exporting the images into a separate folder.

Based on this approach, they have been transformed into reStructuredText to display them in this compendium.
The result can be found in :ref:`exported`
