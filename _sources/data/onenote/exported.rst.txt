Exported Notebooks
==================

To extract more information from the OneNote Notebooks, they have been converted using `Pandoc`_.
For better metadata extraction the reStructuredText (.rst) format serves the need.

The resulting pages contain no images but are rich in metadata.
This is the reason, they are included here.

The titles of most pages could be extracted with find and replace tools and regular expressions (regex) applied.
They contain a lot information about measurements and parameters.
This should help to find some wanted information.
