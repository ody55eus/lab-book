All measurements in this Lab Book are taken while an external magnetic field influences the sample.

The following section contains information about the normal magnetic measurements.
They are measuring the hysteresis loop of a hard magnet.

Because the nanostructures are coupled systems, a small change in the parameters can lead to a
large respnonse of the system.

Hysteresis Loops
++++++++++++++++

Hysteresis Loop at 90deg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All measuements have been measured at @90deg (Parallel setting for best sensitivity).

Parameters
++++++++++

There are a lot of parameters connected to the researched system.
In order to find corellations the following parameters have been studied in detail:


Angle
~~~~~

The goal of this section is to study the influence of an external field at different angles.

The following table shows the different angles and the corresponding measurement numbers for the different structures.
At Angle Â±90deg there is only one measurement as plusses and crosses could be measured simultaneously.
