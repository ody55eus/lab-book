.. warning::
   We had problem when we introduced and exchange gas. The temperature was around 200K 
   and we introduced 1mbar for 1s. The process of cooling was very fast and we lost a 
   lot of He(l). The cooling rate was very high and we reached 4k in 1.5 hour. That was 
   not good and we should next time wait at least one day to cool naturally and then 
   intorduce an exchange gas.

.. important::
   * Don't introduce exchange gas too early ( :math:`T > 200 K` )
   * Be careful and introduce as little exchange gas as possible
