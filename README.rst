Laboratory Book
---------------

This is my `Lab Book`_ for the magnetic fluctuation measurements.
Here, I combine the documentation of all gathered
`data`_
and used software to acquire and analyze the data.
This software includes `EVE`_,
`spectrumanalyzer`_,
`Ana`_,
and `Jupyter Notebooks`_.
The links above point to my online GitLab server,
which is available for reviewers with provided credentials.

The code can be tested in a :doc:`local <info/usage>` Jupyterlab.

All of these services are password protected and
run simultaneously inside
different docker containers on the same server.
This enhances the security of this server immensely.
The amount of different services can sometimes overload the server,
but downtimes are anticipated and monitored
to minimize the impact.
